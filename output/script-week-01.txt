Slide 1

Hello everyone, Nice to meet you. 
My name is Boncho Ku and I have been in charge of 4-5 weeks of all courses in medical statistics.

Maybe some of you may feel a little confusing because I am not Dr. Lee Myeong Soo, who should be teaching the original course. 

I don't know if you've heard the story, but this course is taught by a total of three faculty members. An overview of the main concepts and theories of statistics will be taught by a man in front of you. 

And the practice of data analysis will be conducted by Dr. Mimi Ko. Finally, Dr. Myung-Soo Lee will probably proceed with the contents related to the clinical trial design.

Of course, he is a master in systematic review and meta analysis, but in fact, Dr. Myung-Soo Lee's major is somewhat different from statistics. 

So Dr. Lee asked me and Dr. Mimi Ko to help with this lecture in medical statistics, 
so I am standing here.

Me and Dr. Mimi Ko are not yet UST faculty members. 
And, unfortunately, we haven't yet had experience in providing in-depth lectures on statistics to someone in English. 
So the two of us may seem very inexperienced. 
Maybe most of the lecture can rely on scripts. 
So, we desperately need your understanding now on. 
Anyway, I will do my best to convey my statistical knowledge as easily as possible.


Slide 2

Before entering the world of statistics, let me introduce myself first.

As I already mentioned, my name is Boncho Ku and I'm PhD in Statistics. Currently, I am participating in various projects as a statistician. 

I mainly work as a data scientist in developing statistical learning models, text mining, statistical data linkage to extend the volume of data, and data management. 

In addition, I am responsible for designing clinical studies including RCT.

This slide can be accessed using the URL address noted below anytime.

In addition, if you have any questions about the statistics or during class, 
please feel free to contact me via this email adress.

Then, let's get to the world of statistics. Are you ready?


Slide 3-4

People tend to distrust statistics. 
Several quotes presented on the slide now speak for this.

It is difficult to refute these quotes. 
Most of them are true. 
Why are these quotes regarded as facts from people? 
In fact, statistics are just numerical explanation of measurable phenomena. 
In my opinion, the source of these misunderstandings stems from people's desire to take some sort of advantages from statistics rather than statistics themselves. 
In fact, proper statistics reflect the phenomena we want to know quite accurately.


Slide 5-6
Also, many people say that statistics are difficult. Like the cats on the slide. That's right. Because, even though I have studied statistics for over 20 years, it still feels difficult.
