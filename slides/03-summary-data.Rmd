### **Sample mean**: often called the average, arithmetic mean 

Consider the sample $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ drawn from a population $X$. Its **sample mean** is given by 



$$
\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i = \frac{1}{n} (X_1 + \cdots, +X_n)
$$


> - Example: calculate the mean of five numbers $\{6.5, 6, 5.5, 7.5, 8\}$


$$
\bar{X} = \frac{1}{5} (6.5 + 6 + 5.5 + 7.5 + 8) = 6.7
$$

> Question: is $\bar{X}$ a random variable?


--
#### **Answer**: **Yes** $\rightarrow$ Then what characteristic have?


???

The most basic question to ask of any dataset is ‘What is the typical value?’ 

There are several ways to answer that question and they should be familiar to most students.

**Sample mean** is the first, and probably the most important, example of statistic. 

The importance of the sample mean $\bar{X}$ comes from its use in drawing conclusions about 
the population mean $\mu = E(X)$. Some of the most frequently used inferential procedures are based on 
properties of the sampling distribution of $\bar{X}$.

Since $\bar{X}$ is a random variable, we often are interested in its expectation, variance 
and probability distribution (a.k.a. sampling distribution).

In physics, the expectation holds the same meaning as the center of gravity. 
The distribution can be represented by a series of weights at each outcome, and the mean represents the balancing point.

### How spread is the data from the (sample) mean? 

### **Sample Variance**

> the **average distance** of the observation to the **mean**

Let's consider the $i^{th}$ **deviation** $\rightarrow$ difference (distance) from the sample mean

$$e_i = x_i - \bar{x} $$
### Mean of deviation is always 0!! See

--


$$\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i - \sum_{i=1}^{n}\bar{x} = n\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i - n\bar{x} = n\bar{x} - n\bar{x} = 0$$ 

--

### How to solve?? 

--

> - Taking absolute $|e_i|$ or square $e_i^2$ $\rightarrow$ $e_{i}^2$ is more appropriate $\rightarrow$ **WHY??**



???


The big problem is that about half the deviates are negative and the others are positive. 
What we really care is the distance from the mean, not the sign. So we could either take the absolute value, or square it.

There are some really good theoretical reasons to chose the square option. 
Squared terms are easier to deal with computationally when compared to absolute values. 
More importantly, the spread of the normal distribution is parameterized via squared distances from the mean. 
Because the normal distribution is so important, we’ve chosen to define the sample variance so it matches up with 
the natural spread parameter of the normal distribution. 
So we square the deviations and find the average deviation size (approximately) and call that the sample variance.

### How spread is the data from the (sample) mean? 

### **Sample Variance** is defined as 

$$\hat\sigma^2 = s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2 $$

### Why divided by $n-1$ instead of $n$ ?

> - underestimate the population variance $\sigma^2$
> - If the true mean (population mean) is known, the equation of variance is 

$$\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2 $$


> - We use an estimates of population mean $\bar x$ for the estimation of the $\sigma^2$ $\rightarrow$ using one **degree of freedom**<sup>*</sup> 

 
.footnote[[*] the number of values in the final calculation of a statistic that are free to vary.]


???


The number of independent pieces of information that go into the estimate of a parameter are called the degrees of freedom. 
In general, the degrees of freedom of an estimate of a parameter are equal to the number of independent scores 
that go into the estimate minus the number of parameters used as intermediate steps in the estimation of the parameter itself 
(most of the time the sample variance has N − 1 degrees of freedom, 
since it is computed from N random scores minus the only 1 parameter estimated as intermediate step, which is the sample mean).

### How spread is the data from the (sample) mean? 

#### Calculating the sample variance by hand

> - data: 3, 6, 2, 4, 7 $\rightarrow$ $\bar x$ = `r mean(c(3, 6, 2, 4, 7))`


```{r}
xi <- c(3, 6, 2, 4, 7); mx <- mean(xi)
dev <- xi - mx
devsq <- dev^2
summ <- c("\\(\\sum\\)", 0, sum(devsq))
tab <- tibble(`\\(x_i\\)` = xi, 
              `\\(x_i - \\bar x\\)` = dev, 
              `\\((x_i - \\bar x)^2\\)` = devsq) %>% 
  mutate_all(as.character)
tab <- rbind(tab, summ)
tab %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl(format = "html", 
      align = "ccc", 
      escape = "FALSE", 
      booktabs = TRUE, 
      caption = "Calculation of the Sample Variation") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_paper(bootstrap_options = "condensed", 
                          font_size = 15) %>% 
  kableExtra::row_spec(6, bold = T) 


```

the sample variance is


$$s^2 = \frac{17.2}{n -1} = \frac{17.2}{4} = 4.3$$
