# Two types of statistical analysis

> - **Exploratory data analysis**: analyzing data to summarize their main characteristics $\rightarrow$ classical term: **descriptive statistics**

> - **Statistical inference**:  a set of procedures used in making appropriate conclusions and 
generalizations about a whole (**the population**), based on a limited mumber of observation (**the sample**)
