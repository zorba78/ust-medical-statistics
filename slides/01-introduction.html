### Slides: **https://zorba78.github.io/ust-medical-statistics**


???

Hello everyone. I'm Dr. Boncho Ku and I'm gonna give you several lectures related to statistics in this semester._

This is my introduction. As noted on the slide, I've involved in several research projects as a 
statistician or data scientist at KIOM. I'm currently a member of Digital Health Research Division. 

My main role in projects is data analysis and predictive model development. Also, I designed several 
clinical studies including many RCTs and observational studies. 

As mentioned on the syllabus, this course will be lectured by two professors: me and Dr. Mimi Ko. 
I'm going to provide you an undergraduate-level knowledge of the basic concepts and theories of 
statistics. In Dr. Ko's class, you'll learn more practical basic statistical analysis methods.

# Preface


???

In this first lesson, I would like to briefly talk about why you should learn statistics. 
I understand that the academic background of the students here is not related to statistics. 
However, In the age of big data, as data science becomes established as a discipline, 

The importance of statistical literacy regarding numerical data has been increasingly emphasized in recent times.

This class is focused on improving student's statistical thinking. Learning statistics definitely 
provides us the power to reasonably doubt numbers and distinguish between true and false or 
chance and certainty. 

Then Let's move to step your feet toward the world of statistics.

`\(\rightarrow\)` **Mostly hard to refute** 😭


???

Those two persons on the slide are very famous. Benjamin Disraeli served as a Prime Minister of 
the United Kingdom, and Mark Twain, which was a pen name of Samuel Langhorne Clemens, 
was a famous American writer.

These two guys seem to have a pretty negative view of statistics.

Besides, numerous quotes about statistics are negatively expressed. 

Why did people express the way about statistics like that?

???

Lots of people get nervous as soon as they hear the word ‘statistics.’ Mainly because most folks just don’t like numbers. And to be fair, numbers have fooled people plenty of times. Take all those economic figures you see in the news—they look super official, but the truth is, they’re often twisted, not to show some objective fact, but to push someone’s biased opinion or agenda.

In simple, many statistical numbers that you can see in the newspaper or academic papers are simply the objective result of some sort of calculation from the data. That means these numbers are derived from certain types of quantitative methodologies and numbers themselves have specific meanings depending on their origins. However, many people have desires to interpret those numbers with their own ways and give their subjective meanings by taking advantage of the objectivity of numbers. 

Furthermore, we should pay attention to the term 'objectivity' because objectivity regarding these statistical figures is derived from fair data.

In other words, these quotes mean that you should pay special attention to interpretation and communication, because numbers do not advocate for themselves, and their meanings are completely different depending on your point of view.


Perhaps the reaction of most people who know a little about statistics and hear the word statistics is similar to the cat on the next slide.

However, given the correct data, if you have the literacy to interpret statistics accurately and  correctly, the various statistics provided by statistics have a strong power to understand the phenomenon and make the right decisions.

_Shipman Inquiry_ provides details (data) regarding each victim's age, gender, and year of death


--


#### **What can the statistics tell you about the Shipman's crime?**

_D. Spiegelhalter. The Art of Statistics (2019)_






???


The following slide shows that a general understanding of a specific event is possible only with simple graphs without sophisticated statistical analysis.


This example comes from the book "Art of Statistics", written by David Spiegelhalter, who is a world-renowned statistician. 

Who is the person in the picture? He looks like a genorous grandfather and looks very well educated.

However, He is one of notorious serial killers in England, even though his occupation was a general practitioner.

From 1975 to 1998, he injected overdose of diamorphine into at least 215 of his older patients, causing their deaths.

How Harold Shipman was caught is well explained in Wikipedia, and David's book, so let's skip this part.

Around the beginning of 2000, when he was first convicted of murder, a public investigation began 
to determine if there were any other victims and if he could have been caught earlier. 
This is called Shipman's inquiry. David Spiegelhalter was participated in the investigation 
to gather the necessary evidence as a statistician.

So what can statistics tell us about Shipman's crimes?

Our first question is as follows




---
# **Question**

### What people did Shipman murder?

####  


&lt;img src="Figures/shipman-01-1.svg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

##### _A scatter-plot showing the age and the year of death of Harold Shipman’s 215 confirmed victims. Bar-charts have been added on the axes to reveal the pattern of ages and the pattern of years in which he committed murders._ (epitomized from https://dspiegel29.github.io/ArtofStatistics)


???

The first question is "what people did Shipman kill?

The following scatterplot indicates the relationship between the age and the year of death of Shipman's 
215 confirmed victims. The histograms are added on both axes to show the number of victims according to 
5-year interval ages and years. 

A few patterns can be seen in the picture above. First, as there are more black dots than blue dots, 
Shipman's victims were mainly women.

Looking at the histogram on the vertical axis, most of the victims were in their 70s to 80s, and 
it can be seen that the victims are getting younger over time.

ooking at the histogram on the horizontal axis, there is a blank period in which no murders were 
committed in the early 1990s. The reason for this is that Shipman had previously co-medicated, 
and he felt he was under suspicion. After that he set up his own hospital, and his crimes became bolder.



---
# **Question**

### What time did Shipman commit murder?

&lt;img src="Figures/shipman-02-1.svg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

##### _The time at which Harold Shipman’s patients died, compared to the times at which patients of other local general practitioners died. The pattern does not require sophisticated statistical analysis._ (epitomized from https://dspiegel29.github.io/ArtofStatistics)


???

This is a line graph comparing the time of death of Shipman's patients during the day with 
the time of death of a sample of other local general practitioners.

The data alone doesn't explain why so many victims died at that time, but it is clear that many of 
the Shipman's patients tend to die in the early afternoon.

This example shows that data plays powerful role to ubderstand the given phenomena and make better decision.

## Two main phase in any statistical analysis 

&gt; - **Exploratory data analysis**: analyzing data to summarize their main characteristics


&gt; - **Statistical inference**: a set of procedures used in making appropriate conclusions and 
generalizations about a whole (**the population**), based on a limited mumber of observation (**the sample**)
&gt;    - Generalization `\(\rightarrow\)` **the probability distribution**


## Two important terminologies in statistical inference

&gt; - **Population**: the totality of individual observations for the inference

&gt; - **Sample**: a subset of the population or the part of population that we actually examine to gather information `\(\rightarrow\)` expressed as **DATA** 


---

# Why Sample?? 😐

### Measure everything from POPULATION

- You will get exactly correct answer
- No need to meet a weirdo statistician LIKE ME
- Possible only if you had a plenty of 
    - Money (typing "**SHOW ME THE MONEY**" may help your budget)
    - Time (**TOO SHORT TO COLLECT** all of entire population)
    
### Inferential approach based on SAMPLE

&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 448 512" style="height:1em;position:relative;display:inline-block;top:.1em;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;  &lt;path d="M190.5 66.9l22.2-22.2c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0L441 239c9.4 9.4 9.4 24.6 0 33.9L246.6 467.3c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0l-22.2-22.2c-9.5-9.5-9.3-25 .4-34.3L311.4 296H24c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24v-32c0-13.3 10.7-24 24-24h287.4L190.9 101.2c-9.8-9.3-10-24.8-.4-34.3z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; If we have a proper sample that represents the whole population, you can get NEARLY the correct answer

### Benefits of Sampling
  
&gt; - **Cost**: save the money and time
&gt; - **Utility**: destroying sampling (e.g. examine the life of bulbs)
&gt; - **Accessibility**: impossible to examine a whole population



???


_One can undertake exploratory data analysis without progressing to inference. 
Conversely, in practice any inferential process should always be preceded by 
an exploration of the data in order to understand the data more fully._

### Parameters exist somewhere in the universe 

&gt; - `\(\rightarrow\)` the **TRUE VALUE** for representing the target population 
&gt; - `\(\rightarrow\)` **NO ERROR**
&gt; - Usually notated with Greek letters (e.g. `\(\mu, \sigma, \theta, \psi\)`, ...)


### From the view of _frequentists_, 

&gt; - Parameters are fixed `\(\rightarrow\)` never changing
&gt; - Parameters exists but we never know the true value of them
&gt; - But we can "guess" them from sample


### In Sum, parameters are 

&gt; - any measured quantity of a population `\(\rightarrow\)` **describe the population**
&gt; - usually infered from the **calculated statistics** `\(\rightarrow\)` from the particular sample of **DATA**


???

The term 'frequentist" may be unfamiliar to you. Traditionally, there are two major schools of statistics: frequentist and Bayesian. The main difference between the two is the view point of the parameter. As mentioned on the slide, frequentists regard parameters as fixed values, whereas Bayesians consider parameters as random variables that have their own probability distributions. 

Suppose all existant apples on the planet consist of two colors: red and green and 
there exist huge size of box that could contain all of them. What we're curious about is the proportion of red apples in the box. that is, the true value of the parameter. 

So in this example, let me show you how the two approaches think about the parameter in different ways.


For a frequentist, the parameter θ (the proportion of red apples) is a fixed but unknown value.

👉 Whether the box has 40% or 60% red apples is already determined, but we just don’t know the exact number.

So, we take a sample (pick a few apples) and estimate that proportion.

Here, probability comes only from the randomness of sampling.
For example: “The probability that I pick a red apple is 40%.”

For a Bayesian, the parameter θ itself is considered uncertain.

👉 The proportion of red apples could be 40%, 60%, or many other possibilities, and we represent that uncertainty as a belief distribution.

We start with a prior belief (prior distribution).
(e.g., “In most orchards, about half the apples are red, so θ=0.5 is quite likely.”)

Then we draw a sample and update our belief using that information.
This gives us the posterior probability distribution for θ.
So, we might say: “Now, there’s a high probability that θ is around 0.6.”

# Sample Statistics `\(\sum\)`

### Estimating parameters 

&gt; - calculating **SAMPLE STATISTICS** (a.k.a. **estimator of the population parameter**)
&gt; - **SAMPLE STATISTICS** varied from **different samples of data** `\(\rightarrow\)` inevitably involves **ERROR** `\(\rightarrow\)` **HAVE DISTRIBUTION**
&gt; - A sample statistic should never to be quoted without some estimate of its variation
&gt; - **standard error (SE)** of the sample statistic


$$
\mathrm{SE} = \frac{\hat\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}
$$


### How good is our estimate? `\(\rightarrow\)` less error (variation) and how closer to the true parameter


### _Measurement is ubiquitous_ `\(=\)` _Errors are ubiquitous_

# Estimation &amp; Hypothesis Testing &lt;svg viewBox="0 0 640 512" style="height:1em;position:relative;display:inline-block;top:.1em;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;  &lt;path d="M537.6 226.6c4.1-10.7 6.4-22.4 6.4-34.6 0-53-43-96-96-96-19.7 0-38.1 6-53.3 16.2C367 64.2 315.3 32 256 32c-88.4 0-160 71.6-160 160 0 2.7.1 5.4.2 8.1C40.2 219.8 0 273.2 0 336c0 79.5 64.5 144 144 144h368c70.7 0 128-57.3 128-128 0-61.9-44-113.6-102.4-125.4z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;

### Two basic branches of statistical inference

&gt; - **Estimation**
&gt; - **Hypothesis test**

#### Both make use of statistics calculated from sample data

#### The choise of which to use depends on the question

&gt; - What is the value of something? `\(\rightarrow\)` estimation
&gt; 
&gt;  Versus.
&gt;
&gt; - Are two things the same? `\(\rightarrow\)` hypothesis testing


The basic principle of estimation &amp; hypothesis are the same for **ALL** types of parameters and statistics 
but the details may change. 

- test statistics 
- standard error
- probability distribution
