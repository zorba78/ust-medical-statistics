_Hello everyone. I'm Dr. Boncho Ku and I'm gonna give you several lectures related to statistics._

_ I assume that you guys are somewhat confused because Dr. Lee does not come up to the class._ 

_ Instead, someone not shown in the syllabus talks about statistics._

# Definition

### So then, **what is STATISTICS?**

--
> #### Statistics is concerned with scientific methods for **collecting**, **organizing**, **summarizing**, **presenting** and **analyzing** DATA


--
### **Why STATISTICS?**

--
> #### To draw **valid conclusions** and **making reasonable decisions** based on analyzing **DATA**

# Important Things in Statistics `r icons::fontawesome("exclamation-circle", style = "solid")`

---

# `r icons::fontawesome("table", style = "solid")` Data 

### Characteristics or information collected through observation 

--

> - Observation
>   - Investigation (or survey)
>   - Experiment
> - Usually numeric values (or text that are quantified)
> - Object of quantitative (statistical) analysis 
> - Source of knowledge

--

### Technically, Data can be defined as 

--

> - A set of values of **qualitative** or **quantitative** **VARIABLES**

--

#### In Sum, Data are **measured**, **collected**, and **analyzed**

# `r icons::fontawesome("lightbulb", style = "solid")` Inference 

## Two main phase in any statistical analysis 

> - **Exploratory data analysis**: analyzing data to summarize their main characteristics


> - **Statistical inference**: a set of procedures used in making appropriate conclusions and 
generalizations about a whole (**the population**), based on a limited mumber of observation (**the sample**)
>    - Generalization $\rightarrow$ **the probability distribution**


## Two important terminologies in statistical inference

> - **Population**: the totality of individual observations for the inference

> - **Sample**: a subset of the population or the part of population that we actually examine to gather information $\rightarrow$ expressed as **DATA** 


---

# Why Sample?? `r emo::ji("meh")`

### Measure everything from POPULATION

- You will get exactly correct answer
- No need to meet a weirdo statistician LIKE ME
- Possible only if you had a plenty of 
    - Money (typing "**SHOW ME THE MONEY**" may help your budget)
    - Time (**TOO SHORT TO COLLECT** all of entire population)
    
### Inferential approach based on SAMPLE

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-right", style = "solid")` If we have a proper sample that represents the whole population, you can get NEARLY the correct answer

### Benefits of Sampling
  
> - **Cost**: save the money and time
> - **Utility**: destroying sampling (e.g. examine the life of bulbs)
> - **Accessibility**: impossible to examine a whole population



???


_One can undertake exploratory data analysis without progressing to inference. 
Conversely, in practice any inferential process should always be preceded by 
an exploration of the data in order to understand the data more fully._

# Parameters and Estimates


---


# Parameters `r icons::fontawesome("bible", style = "solid")`

### Parameters exist somewhere in the universe 

> - $\rightarrow$ the **TRUE VALUE** for representing the target population 
> - $\rightarrow$ **NO ERROR**
> - Usually notated with Greek letters (e.g. $\mu, \sigma, \theta, \psi$, ...)


### From the view of _frequentists_, 

> - Parameters are fixed $\rightarrow$ never changing
> - Parameters exists but we never know the true value of them
> - But we can "guess" them from sample


### In Sum, parameters are 

> - any measured quantity of a population $\rightarrow$ **describe the population**
> - usually infered from the **calculated statistics** $\rightarrow$ from the particular sample of **DATA**


---


# Sample Statistics $\sum$

### Estimating parameters 

> - calculating **SAMPLE STATISTICS** (a.k.a. **estimator of the population parameter**)
> - **SAMPLE STATISTICS** varied from **different samples of data** $\rightarrow$ inevitably involves **ERROR** $\rightarrow$ **HAVE DISTRIBUTION**
> - A sample statistic should never to be quoted without some estimate of its variation
> - **standard error (SE)** of the sample statistic


$$
\mathrm{SE} = \frac{\hat\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}
$$


### How good is our estimate? $\rightarrow$ less error (variation) and how closer to the true parameter


### _Measurement is ubiquitous_ $=$ _Errors are ubiquitous_

---

# Estimation & Hypothesis Testing `r icons::fontawesome("cloud", style = "solid")`

### Two basic branches of statistical inference

> - **Estimation**
> - **Hypothesis test**

#### Both make use of statistics calculated from sample data

#### The choise of which to use depends on the question

> - What is the value of something? $\rightarrow$ estimation
> 
>  Versus.
>
> - Are two things the same? $\rightarrow$ hypothesis testing


The basic principle of estimation & hypothesis are the same for **ALL** types of parameters and statistics 
but the details may change. 

- test statistics 
- standard error
- probability distribution
